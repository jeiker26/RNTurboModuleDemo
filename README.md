## üë©‚Äçüíª Installing the app

1. Clone the demo app repository:
   `git clone https://github.com/anishamalde/RNTurboModuleDemo.git`

Within the folder you will find 2 subfolder:

- RTNDeviceName which is a Turbo Module that returns the Native device name
- TMDemo which is a TS app that implements the TurboModule and displays the device name

2. From the TMDemo folder, install the dependencies by running:

```
npm i
```

This installs all the dependencies including the Turbo Module.
